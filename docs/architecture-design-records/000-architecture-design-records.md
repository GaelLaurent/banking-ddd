Accepted

## Context

As this project is playground to learn and experiment patterns, way of doing things, a lot of decisions will be taken, it's necessary to keep track of those decisions.

## Decision

All decisions will be recorded as Architecture Decision Records (ADR).
Some decision which is not directly Architecture decision but decision impacting the development will be recorded too.

Each ADR will be recorded using [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which contains following sections: Status, Context, Decision and Consequences.

## Consequences

All architectural decisions should be recorded. Old decisions should be recorded as well with an approximate decision date. New decisions should be recorded on a regular basis.
