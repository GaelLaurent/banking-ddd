# Banking DDD

## What ?
The idea of this project is to follow the [Domain-Driven Design starter modeling process](https://github.com/ddd-crew/ddd-starter-modelling-process) with a simple example inspired from the [banking kata](https://kata-log.rocks/banking-kata).

It's also a playground to use patterns from the tactical part of the DDD approach, craftsmanship concept and good practices and learn.

I will try to keep note about thinking and choice along the design and development.

ADR [Architecture Design Record](docs/architecture-design-records/) will be used to record decisions along the development.
